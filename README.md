Problem Statement: You have a long, insulated rod of unknown thermal conductivity, k. 
The rod has a uniform cross-sectional area A and is of length L.
At time t=0, one end of the rod (x=0) is suddenly heated and maintained at a constant temperature T1,
while the other end (x=L) is maintained at a constant temperature T2.
The initial temperature of the entire rod is T0.
You have a sensor that measures the temperature at a specific point xs along the rod at various times.
The goal is to determine the thermal conductivity, k, of the rod using the temperature measurements.
This is an inverse heat conduction problem (IHCP), which is notoriously difficult due to its ill-posed nature;
small errors in temperature measurements can lead to large errors in the estimated thermal conductivity.
